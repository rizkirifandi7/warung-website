# KopiKing

## Multi-Purpose Company Profile

This project is a company profile website developed using Laravel 11. It features an admin panel that allows easy management of pages and menus, providing an intuitive interface for administrators to update content seamlessly. This project serves as a personal milestone in my journey to learn Laravel 11, and I plan to continue enhancing its features and functionality in the future.

## Requirements

-   [npm](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
-   [XAMPP 8.2.4 or later](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/download/)

## Features

-   Admin Dashboard: Manage Categories, Menus, Messages, and Web Pages.
-   User-Friendly Front Page: The source code includes a simple and easy-to-navigate front page with sections for Home, Menu, About, and Contact, making it accessible for all users.

## Getting Started

Here, youâ€™ll find the essential steps to set up and navigate through the project. Follow these simple instructions to explore the features of the website and make the most of your experience.

1. Clone the Repository

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/josephines1/kopi-king.git
    ```

2. Install Dependencies

    ```console
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

3. Copy the Environment File

    ```console
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Set Database Connection. Open the .env file in a text editor and set your database connection details:

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=laravel11-kopi-king
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

5. Generate the Application Key

    ```console
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. Create Storage Link

    ```console
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

7. Update the Filesystem Disk. Open your `.env` file and change the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` value from `local` to `public`:

    ```
     FILESYSTEM_DISK=public
    ```

8. Run Migrations

    ```console
    php artisan migrate
    ```

9. Seed the Database

    ```console
    php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder
    php artisan db:seed --class=FrontPagesSeeder
    ```

10. Compile Assets

    ```console
    npm run dev
    ```

11. Run the Application
    ```console
    php artisan serve
    ```

## First Usage

After running the seed commands mentioned above, you can log in to the admin panel using the following credentials:

```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: password
```

Once logged in, you can start exploring the interface and adding the necessary media files and photos for the website. To access the admin page, append /admin to the main URL. For example:

-   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`
-   `http://laravel11-kopi-king.test/admin`

This will redirect you to the login page.
